# Tactobot
Contact sensing in Robot Manipulators.

This is the code for the course project 'Tactobot' for CS225A:Experimental Robotics (Fall'15). This code is built using the Standard Control Library (SCL) (https://bitbucket.org/samirmenon/scl-manips-v2) which interfaces high level controllers with the most common Robots. This code is tailored to work for the Barrett WAM arm. This repo does not contain the SCL files.
