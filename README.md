# Tactobot
Contact sensing in Robot Manipulators.

This is the code for the course project 'Tactobot' in CS225A:Experimental Robotics (Spring'15). It is built using the Standard Control Library (SCL) (https://bitbucket.org/samirmenon/scl-manips-v2) which interfaces high level controllers with the most common Robots and this particular code is tailored to work for the Barrett WAM arm. This repo does not contain the SCL files.
